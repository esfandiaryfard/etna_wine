# Etna Wine Analysis

Main repo of project: https://github.com/biagio-incardona/Analysis_Wine_Questionnaire

For this project my team and I we designed the questionar form as you see about the Etna wine and we spread it between people living in Italy to understand if 
they know Etna wine and what is their opinion about it.

The form was in both Italian and English Language to have more groups of people (Italians and non Italians) participate in our research. After that my team and I 
wemerged and translated data and started to do anaysis that you can read more about in pdf file and a summary of that in presentation file.

The code is done in sas. And Sas was our main tool to do this project
